# wasmhive
Project for scripts compiled to WASM for games compiled to WASM

## ?

The idea is to use WASM's shared-memory feature (proposal) to allow developers to code extensions and userscripts in other languages besides JS, for websites and applications coded in other languages besides JS. Of course there will always be the glue code, but this is a proof of possibility.

The example script(s) uploaded are from the video game arras.io, coded in Rust compiled to wasm.
